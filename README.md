# Image-Crypt

### An image encryption and decryption project
This a menu driven program encrypts your image with a very secure key (cannot be brute forced in an optimal ammount of time)
and decrypts it as well!
It also keeps track of the files you encrypt.
Currently due to lack of time, it does not have a GUI.
I hope you like it!
###How does it work?
